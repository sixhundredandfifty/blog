I like elections (and I cannot lie). I also like playing around with data. Sometimes I combine these things, and I thought I'd start a blog to share what I've been looking at with interested friends. This is it.

This is not a professional forecasting website. I am not an academic or professional psephologist. I'm an amateur looking at the data and trying to make sense of things for my own interest. I find this stuff interesting - I hope you do too.

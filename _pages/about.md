I like elections (and I cannot lie). I also like playing around with data. Sometimes I combine these things, and I thought I'd start a blog to share what I'm looking at with interested friends. This is it.

The blog is focused on UK elections, and on trying to develop a picture of the 650 constituencies that elect MPs to the House of Commons. It's by understanding these - their make-up, their number, and the way they behave - that we can begin to understand why elections turn out as they do, and what the different political parties are doing to influence that.

This is not a professional forecasting website. I am not an academic or professional psephologist. I'm an amateur looking at the data and trying to make sense of things for my own interest. I find this stuff interesting - I hope you do too.

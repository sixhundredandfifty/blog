I like elections (and I cannot lie). I also like playing around with data. I thought I'd set up a blog to share with friends who also like these things. This is it.

This is not a professional forecasting website. I am not an academic or professional psephologist. I'm an amateur looking at the data and trying to make sense of things for my own interest.

This blog is about various things I find interesting. I hope you do too.

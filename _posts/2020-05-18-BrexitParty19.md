In a [previous post]({% post_url 2020-05-17-election2019 %}) I noted that the Conservatives' hard pro-Brexit stance helped to neutralise the threat of the Brexit Party in the pro-Leave seats it was hoping to take from Labour. 

But the Brexit Party still increased its vote share by around 4% in the  Leave-supporting seats where it stood. What impact did that have on the overall result?

There are two things to consider in coming to an answer:
* In how many constituencies did the Brexit Party win enough votes to make a difference to the result in that constituency?
* How would Brexit Party voters have voted if the party hadn't stood?

In answer to the first question, we could say that the Brexit Party "made a difference" to the result in a seat if the top-placing two parties in a seat were on different sides of the Brexit debate, and if the Brexit Party polled more votes than the margin between the two at the election. There were 59 such seats - the table below shows which party came first in these seats (the rows) and which came second (the columns):

|     | Con | Lab | Brexit | Lib Dem |
|-----|-----|-----|--------|---------|
| Con | 0   | 19  | 0      | 1      |
| Lab | 36  | 0   | 2      | 0       |
| PC  | 1   | 0   | 0      | 0       |

So, from a purely numerical perspective, it looks like there were enough Brexit Party voters to have helped the Conservatives gain 19 seats from Labour (and 1 from the Lib Dems). But on the other hand it looks like there were also enough to have helped Labour and Plaid Cymru defend 39 seats from the Conservatives. (Note that, in the two seats where the Brexit Party came second, the combined Brexit and Conservative vote was greater than Labour's tally, so I include these in the 39 number.)

But what would actually have happened in these seats depends on what Brexit Party voters would have done if the party hadn't been standing in their constituency. There are three main options:
* **Vote Conservative**: It's reasonable to assume that if someone is voting for the Brexit Party then they care about Brexit. Since the Conservatives were the only other party campaigning on pro-Brexit line, Brexit Party voters might have put their cross in the Conservative box instead. In this scenario, the Conservatives might have gained those 39 extra seats, giving them 404 seats in total and an even bigger majority of 158.
* **Vote Labour**: The Conservatives were running on a very clear pro-Brexit platform, so you might wonder what would make someone vote for the Brexit Party when in practical terms this would just make a Conservative victory (and therefore Brexit) less likely. It could be that Brexit Party voters, many of whom were traditional Labour voters, just couldn't bring themselves to vote Conservative. With no Brexit Party candidate standing, these voters might therefore have voted Labour instead. In this case, the Conservatives might have won up to 19 fewer seats, putting them on 346 - still giving them a majority, but a smaller one, of 42. (I'm assuming that Brexit Party voters would not have voted for the Liberal Democrats, and so am excluding that 1 seat from this calculation.)
* **Abstain**: Perhaps more likely than voting Labour, traditional Labour supporters who voted for the Brexit Party might, without a Brexit candidate, have stayed at home rather than vote Conservative or support a Labour Party they no longer agreed with. In this scenario, the result would have been exactly the same as the 2019 election.

Of course, the true answer to what Brexit Party voters would have done if the Party had not stood is probably a mixture of three options above. I haven't been able to find any reliable polls on alternative voting intention, and it's not clear how informative such hypothetical surveys are anyway. 

**In conclusion**, the answer of whether the Brexit Party helped or hindered the Conservatives by fielding candidates isn't totally clear. But, either way, it doesn't seem that the Party's decision to stand changed the broad result: a Conservative majority.

In the run up to the 2019 election, there was a lot of talk about tactical voting by Remain voters potentially depriving the Conservatives of a majority.  This post examines whether this was feasible, by considering four related questions:

* Did any pro-Remain tactical voting actually happen in the election, and did it work?
* Were there theoretically enough Remain voters to deprive the Conservatives of a majority?
* Why didn’t more people vote tactically?
* What would have happened if both Leave and Remain parties had agreed electoral pacts?[^1]

When I say ‘Remain’ voters / parties, I’m including people and parties supporting a second referendum, as well as those supporting outright remaining in the EU. Which is not strictly the same thing. But it *is* shorter.

## Did any pro-Remain tactical voting actually happen in the election, and did it work?

Some tactical voting did happen on the Remain side - we know this because [post-election polls](https://lordashcroftpolls.com/2019/12/how-britain-voted-and-why-my-2019-general-election-post-vote-poll/) tell us so. But it’s also evident in some of the results in individual seats.

Take a look at Chart 1, which shows the change in Labour and Lib Dem vote share in each constituency. 

**Chart 1 - Change in Labour and Lib Dem vote share in each constituency, 2017 - 2019, coloured by estimated Leave vote**

As two of the largest pro-Remain parties, tactical voting should be clear from examples where their vote went up or down by much more than the national average (in which Labour lost 8% and the Lib Dems gained 4%). And you can pick out some of the clearest examples:
* In the top left corner, there’s a handful of seats where the Labour vote went up and the Lib Dem vote went down, in a reverse of the national picture. In these seats (for example, **Canterbury**, **Portsmouth South**, and **Southport**), Labour was neck and neck with the Conservatives in 2017, so it looks like Lib Dem tactical voting was at work. This wasn’t enough for Labour to take Southport from the Conservatives, but it helped them defend the other two seats, which it had won in 2017.
* Similarly, in the lower right hand quadrant, **St Albans** had Labour down 15% and the Lib Dems up 18%, both much bigger changes than the national average. The Conservatives had an 11% majority over the Lib Dems in the seat in 2017, and their vote fell by only 4% in 2019 - the above-average rise in the Lib Dem vote in 2019 allowed them to gain the constituency.
* In the lower left-hand quadrant, both the Labour and Lib Dem vote went down in the moderately pro-Remain **Beaconsfield** and **South West Hertfordshire**, where former Conservatives Dominic Grieve and David Gauke were standing in opposition to the Government’s Brexit deal. But this wasn’t sufficient for either of them to win their seats.

So some tactical voting happened, but clearly it only made a difference in a handful of seats.

## Were there theoretically enough pro-remain voters to deprive the Conservatives of a majority?
Theoretically, yes: if you add up the votes secured by all the pro-Remain parties in each of the seats won by the Conservatives, you find that that total is higher than the Conservative total in 67 of them. So if Remain voters (those supporting pro-Remain parties) had all voted for a single party in their constituency, the Conservatives would have won 67 fewer seats, putting them on 298 - 28 short of majority. The pro-Remain parties combined in this scenario would have won 333 - a majority of 16 - though no single party would have had an outright majority (Labour would have been the largest party in the bloc, on 246).

But in the absence of an explicit electoral pact between the Remain parties - which did not happen - clearly this is an extreme scenario: it would have required **all** voters in the Remain bloc to switch to the most credible challenger to the Conservatives in each seat. 

Table 1 instead shows what the result would have been if only a certain percentage of voters in the Remain bloc had voted tactically (above and beyond those who did, whose tactical switch will already be reflected in the results). Even to barely deprive Conservatives of majority, 60% of Remain bloc voters would have to have switched their vote - still a significant number.[^2] And this doesn’t account for any additional tactical voting on the Leave side (we’ll come to that later). 

**Table 1 - Potential effect of tactical voting on Conservative majority**

| Percentage of Remain supporters voting tactically | Decrease in Con seats | Total Con seats |
|-----|--------|---------|
| 0%     | 0      | 365     |
| 10%   | 5     | 360  |
| 20%   | 11      | 354      |
| 30%   | 18    | 347 |
| 40%   | 28    | 337   |
| 50%   | 34    | 331   |
| 60%   | 40    | 325   |
| 70%   | 43    | 322   |
| 80%   | 48    | 317   |
| 90%   | 58    | 307   |
| 100%   | 67      | 298       |

The seats that the Conservatives would have won in each scenario are highlighted in Chart 2 (if you hover over each point, you can see more information about the seat, including the percentage tactical vote at which it would have flipped). The vulnerable seats were, as you would expect, all the Conservatives’ most marginal seats, as well as some safer seats in which pro-Remain parties attracted a large proportion of the vote, but split it between them.

**Chart 2 - Conservative seats won at the 2019 election in order of majority, coloured by estimated Leave vote. Seats that would have changed hands with pro-Remain tactical voting are in bold.**

So, while it would have taken a lot of switching, there were theoretically enough votes out there for pro-Remain parties to stop the Conservatives getting a majority by voting tactically. Why didn’t this happen?

## Were Remain supporters unwilling to vote tactically in sufficient numbers? Or did they just not know how?

There’s certainly some evidence that voters weren’t sure ‘how’ to vote tactically - that is, which party to vote for as the main credible challenger to the Conservatives. 

For example, take another look at the lower right hand quadrant of Chart 1, where there are about a dozen seats in London and the South West estimated to have voted remain in 2016, in which Labour came second to the Conservatives in 2017. In some cases Labour was beaten by only a small margin (e.g. **Finchley and Golders Green**, **Cities of London and Westminster**, and **Wimbledon**). But the fall in Labour’s popularity since 2017, alongside the Lib Dem’s strong performance in London in the 2019 local and European elections, meant that [it was unclear which the best-placed party was in 2019 to challenge the Conservatives](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/07/jo-swinson-tactical-voting-general-election). In the end, the Lib Dem vote rose enormously and the Labour vote fell, and this split in the Remain vote allowed the Conservatives to hang on to all of these seats - even though the combined vote for Remain parties in some of them was 60%.

But confusion wasn’t necessarily the only factor at work in these seats.  It could be that voters in these pro-Remain constituencies preferred the Lib Dem’s policy of revoking Article 50 to Labour’s more equivocal promise of a second referendum. And Labour might also have lost support because people simply didn’t want to vote for them, for the [same reasons](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/12/23/their-own-words-why-voters-abandoned-labour)  that other voters all over the country turned away from the party. [Constituency-level polling](http://www.deltapoll.co.uk/polls/finchley-golders-poll) in some of these pro-Remain seats certainly suggests that Lib Dem supporters were less willing to vote tactically for Labour than vice versa. It could simply be that Lib Dem supporters liked the party and its policies and weren’t willing to vote tactically.

We can find more evidence on whether people were willing to switch by looking at seats on the other end of the Leave/Remain spectrum, where the question of the main challenger was more clear cut and so voter confusion is not likely to have been an obstacle. 

Let’s take **Wrexham** - one of Labour’s ‘Red Wall’ seats gained by the Conservatives with a majority of 8%, which is estimated to have voted heavily (58%) for Leave in 2016, was well publicised throughout the campaign as being one of the Conservatives’ top targets, and where additional tactical voting would need to have been at the critical 60% level to swing the seat for Labour. Labour was the only prospective challenger here, having won 48.9% of the vote in 2017 to the Conservatives’ 43.7%, and the Lib Dems were unlikely to make up significant ground in such a pro-Leave seat. But there’s little evidence that other Remain party voters lent their support to Labour: the Lib Dem and Plaid Cymru vote went up slightly, both in terms of percentage and number of votes, while the Labour vote fell by 10%. 

And there are a host of other seats that the Conservatives took from Labour with small majorities which show the same pattern, where a modest amount of tactical voting could have swung it for Labour - **Heywood and Middleton**, **Blyth Valley**, and **Bolton North East**. It’s hard to make these out on Chart 2 because the vote changes on the Remain side weren’t enormously different to the national average so they’re clustered round a load of other seats - no clear evidence of tactical voting at all.  Voters for the other Remain parties in these seats presumably just weren’t willing to vote Labour, even to keep the Conservatives out.

So it looks like there was a combination of confusion and limited willingness of some Remain voters to switch. And so, while it’s difficult to unpick how much each factor was at play, given how much switching would have been required, it seems unlikely that tactical voting could ever in reality have reached the levels required to change the result. At least, in the absence of a formal electoral pact…

## What would have happened if both Leave and Remain voters had agreed electoral pacts?

This is where it gets really fun. 

Let’s imagine that the pro-Remain and pro-Leave parties both agreed electoral pacts, where only one party from each side would stand in each constituency. And let’s further imagine that they agreed with perfect foresight which party would perform best in each constituency (i.e. assume that the best-performing Leave or Remain party in each constituency, according to the actual 2019 results, was the one chosen to stand for the Leave or Remain side).

These are already two big assumptions. But let’s further assume that all the people who voted for Remain parties in a constituency in the actual election would have voted for the single chosen Remain party, and the same on the Leave side. That’s obviously a huge assumption, as we’ve already said that many voters probably just didn’t want to support a party other than their own - in reality, in the event of an electoral pact, they might just have stayed at home. Or even switched sides (for example, in the case of pro-Leave voters who stuck with Labour - Brexit was the biggest issue at the election, but it still wasn’t everything…)

But anyway, all of those caveats aside, just for interest, this is what the House of Commons would have looked like in this scenario (649 seats in total: 650 minus the Speaker):

So in this highly theoretical situation, it looks like the Government would still have had enough seats to push through the Brexit deal it had negotiated - just. And would have enough, by a more comfortable margin, to push through a Brexit of some sort. 

This is despite the fact that Remain-supporting parties had a small lead over Leave-supporting ones in the total national vote share. Part of the explanation for this is that there are simply more seats estimated to have voted Leave than Remain - 403 vs 229 in Great Britain (estimates aren’t available for Northern Ireland). Seen like this, it’s perhaps surprising that, in this electoral pact scenario, the Conservatives don’t win a bigger majority. The reason, presumably, is simply that people didn’t vote solely based on their position on Brexit, even in this election - which is why you should take this whole scenario with a big pinch of salt; **and another reason why the potential of tactical voting to swing the election was overplayed**.


[^1]: Throughout this post, I take the pro-Remain / second referendum parties and candidates to be Labour, the Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party, Change UK (in Broxtowe, Nottingham East and Ilford South), and the various Independent candidates opposed to Brexit or the Government’s Brexit approach: Dominic Grieve in Beaconsfield, David Gauke in South West Hertfordshire, Anne Milton in Guildford, Gavin Shuker in Luton South. In the parts that relate to Northern Ireland, I also include Sinn Fein, the SDLP and the Alliance in the pro-Remain camp. The pro-Leave camp I take to be the Conservatives, the Brexit Party, and - in Northern Ireland - the DUP and UUP (the UUP having supported Remain in the referendum but then supported Leave in the 2019 election). In addition, the Brexit Party, DUP and UUP did not support the Government’s Brexit deal.

[^2]: Technically, this 60% number only applies to the final 3 constituencies of the 42 that would need to be flipped to overturn the Conservative majority; i.e. only 10% would need to have voted tactically in the 5 most marginal seats, only 20% in the next 6 most marginal etc. But even for a single constituency, 60% is a big ask.
